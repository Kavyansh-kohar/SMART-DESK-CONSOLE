# SMART-DESK-CONSOLE
Smart Desk Console is a voice assistant–powered desk device built using reused e-waste. Powered by an old smartphone, it works as a 24×7 clock, alarm, Bluetooth speaker, and CCTV system. The project focuses on sustainability, electronics understanding, and achieving maximum functionality without coding, rooting, or custom software.
